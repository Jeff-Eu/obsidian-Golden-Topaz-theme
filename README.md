Golden Topaz theme for Obsidian
This is a theme designed to create a more inspiring, transcendent and sublime environment for reading, thinking and writing in Obsidian.

The theme started out as a set of snippets on top of the [Blue Topaz](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/theme-blue-topaz-v2-4-updated-20210403-for-v0-11-12/6425) as soon as I realized [WhyI](https://forum.obsidian.md/u/whyI)’s Blue Topaz does all the features I was ever trying to do in my DIY snippets and got the job done in a much nicer way. I have worked to collect colours from photos, websites as inspirations to make it more aesthetically appealing. I hope the Golden Topaz calms and reassures your emotional energies the way it did to me and my friends.

If you like a cuter and the more adorable theme, check out my [Pink Topaz](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/pink-topaz-theme-for-flowers-and-sweetness/18451). :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
